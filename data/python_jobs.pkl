VProgram must be created using Python 3\u000a\u000aProblem Description: \u000aCreate a text base game to try and hit a target in two dimensional plane (X,Y) using a cannon ball. \u000a\u000aThe program will randomly create 5 targets (5 sets of X,Y) and display the set on screen. Choose the coordinates of the targets such that:  500 < X < 5000 (meters) and 500 < Y < 5000 (meters)\u000aThe player will have 3 chances to hit any of the 5 square targets, which are 10 X 10 meters. The player will attempt to hit the targets by entering the initial velocity and initial angle. The coordinate of the target is at the center of the target.\u000a\u000aIf the player hits a target, the program will display the name, the number of tries used, a message indicating that the player won, the time it took to hit the target (time of flight for the hit try), and the target number with audible beeps for indication that a target was hit. If the player did not hit any target in 3 tries, the program will display the initial angles and the initial velocities that were needed to hit each target and list them on the screen.\u000a\u000aRegardless of win or lose, the program must record the target numbers and their coordinates in a file with the players name (a name from namepass.txt, below), for example output.txt\u000aThe game can be played only if the user first enters a correct name and corresponding correct ID. The list of names and ID\u2019s are given in a text file called namepass.txt, such as below\u000a\u000a          leia       12345 \u000a          darth     23456 \u000a          r2d2     34567 \u000a          solo      45678 \u000a          jabba    56789 \u000a          yoda      67890\u000a. \u000aGame Requirements:\u000a1.	Must use a 2D list for targets for each game. The members of the list are: target # (1 to 5) and coordinate of the target (X,Y)\u000a2.	The player must enter a correct name and matching ID (in namepass.txt file) to get access to the game\u000a3.	Player can choose to play again\u000a4.	Use random number generator for X and Y of each target\u000a5.	Must save the result in a file\u000a6.	The program must handle one type of exception.\u000a\u000aMore requirements, in addition the above: \u000a1.	The main function must do very little other than calling other functions and passing parameters to those functions.\u000a2.	The program should be modularly designed with functions designed to do one task and one task well.\u000a3.	Do not use global variables. Pass data back and forth via parameters or as return values.\u000a4.	Make the functions as general as possible so that they can be called more than once if needed.\u000a5.	Use defined constants for ALL constants (if any) in your program.\u000a6.	The source code file must include comments documenting the design. \u000a7.	Indentation and spacing should be used to make the program readable. \u000a8.	Not permitted to use the following commands: continue, break, exit, or any library functions that perform similarly\u000a

VI am looking for a python developer to modify code retrieved from Git Hub, and modify the code accordingly to be compatible with my current version of MySQL database.  The code will connect to one site, download all the information provided and then implement on my database. \u000a \u000aMy request is to run the code and dump all of the information provided by the site into my local database so that I can localize my search results instead of calling out API requests every time to the other site as I am charged every time I do this.  \u000a\u000aI expect a dump of a minimum of 2mill+ entries that are NOT BLANK into my database.\u000a \u000aIt is important to note that I want a functioning RUNNABLE script that may be reused in the future as I intend to use cronjobs to automatically run the script to feed us again with new entries and updates that come out every week.\u000a\u000aIf you know python, this should take you less than a few hours.

VWe are looking to build a webtool that will scrape a set of blog websites and pull out the YouTube and Vimeo videos that are being shared most frequently and rank them by popularity.  We'd like to be able to watch the videos from within the tool.  This would be a web-based tool, closed to only those who have credentials.  We already have a tool (I believe it was built in python) that currently curates from a specified set of YouTube channels, using the YouTube API (but doesn't search for Vimeo videos).  If this tool could be integrated into that tool, that would be ideal.  We'd also like the ability to sort the results by the category that the video is in (for YouTube - Gaming, Music, DIY, etc).  Not sure if there are similar categories for Vimeo videos.\u000a\u000aWe'd also like to integrate the donReach API, or another suitable tool, that could find how many times these videos have been shared on social media outlets.  There is a tool called Sharetally.co that does this, but it unfortunately doesn't have an open API and you can only search for videos one at a time.\u000a\u000aFor an example of the kind of tool we're looking for, but with a different focus (music), see the hypemachine.com.\u000a\u000aHere is the wish list of sites to cull through (each of these probably have pagination challenges to them):\u000ahttp://www.wimp.com/\u000ahttp://Buzzfeed.com/videos\u000ahttp://digg.com/video\u000ahttp://tubefilter.com\u000ahttp://dailydot.com/topics/entertainment\u000ahttps://www.reddit.com/r/videos/\u000ahttp://www.google.com/trends/hotvideos#geo=US&hvsm=0\u000ahttps://www.youtube.com/trendsdashboard?show_extra_controls=1#num_results=50&loc0=all_803&loc1=all_622\u000ahttp://thedailywh.at/\u000ahttp://devour.com/\u000ahttp://io9.gizmodo.com/tag/videos\u000ahttp://gizmodo.com/tag/video\u000ahttp://gawker.com/tag/video\u000ahttp://laughingsquid.com/\u000ahttp://www.mostwatchedtoday.com/\u000ahttp://www.popscreen.com/\u000ahttp://www.tastefullyoffensive.com/\u000ahttp://unreel.co/\u000ahttp://www.viralviralvideos.com/\u000ahttp://whatstrending.com/categories/video\u000a\u000aWe'd also like to add sites as we go, but understood that each site would have it's own challenges when integrating into the tool.

VI'm searching for an expert on python or c++, open CV and robotics. \u000aThe aim of the project is to write a script (either python or c++) for commanding an open source robotic arm (uarm) with a webcam similar to this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIeP1g6ww_g\u000aThe uarm should assemble the cubes I have design in a particular arrangement (my arrangement as well). There are more github python scripts available that could serve as starting idea. I can share them on request.\u000aThe script should contain a line (or a set) of code where one inputs the final structure. \u000aI'm aware that not everybody has uarm equipped with the webcam laying around, thus I will be fully available to test the script on request. The project consists in 2 parts and this is the first one. The cubes and spatial arrangement will be provided afterwards. \u000aLooking forward to start this project.
